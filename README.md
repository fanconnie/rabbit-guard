# Advanced Rabbit Deterrence System

## Project Overview

fanconnie presents a sophisticated rabbit deterrence system using computer vision on a Raspberry Pi and Roboflow to detect and deter rabbits from your garden. Whenever a Rabbit is detected, the system triggers a noise like a baby crying or a car honking from a Bluetooth speaker, intended to scare the rabbit away.

## Special Features of the System

This system provides unique features including:

- Model training using Roboflow Train (based on YOLOv5, cutting-edge object detection model)
- Portable operation with the MakerHawk External Power Supply
- Active learning via the Roboflow Upload API
- Remote view of detections through a Flask Web Server
- Bluetooth Speaker Integration for rabbit deterrence
